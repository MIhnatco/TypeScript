        <h1>Iterators</h1>
        <p>
            
            In TypeScript, iterators are objects that provide a way to access the elements 
            of a collection (e.g., an array, set, or custom data structure) one at a time, 
            without exposing the underlying details of the collection.

        <h2>Generator</h2>
        <p>
            In TypeScript, a generator is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed, 
            allowing for more flexible and efficient control flow. Generator functions are denoted by the function* syntax, 
            and when called, 
            they return a generator object that follows the iterator interface, which includes the <strong>next</strong>, <strong>return</strong>, and <strong>throw</strong> functions
        </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/generator.png" alt="">
        </figure>
        <p>
            Here's an example of a simple generator function:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        function* generatorFunction(): Generator&lt;number&gt;{
            console.lot("This is a generator function");
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
        }

        const generator = generatorFunction();
        console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
        console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 2, done: false }
        console.log(generator.next()); // { value: 3, done: false }
        console.log(generator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
    </code>
</pre>
    <p>
        In this example, the generator function <strong>generatorFunction</strong> is called, and 
        a generator object is returned. Each call to the next function on the generator object 
        will pause the execution of the generator function and return an object with a value and done property. 
        The value property represents the value yielded by the generator, 
        and the done property indicates whether the generator has finished yielding values.
    </p>

    <p>
        Generators 'yield a value'...
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Used in generator functions to convert them into generators, which can be exited and re-entered
    </li>
    <li>
        Pauses the execution of a generator and returns an IteratorResult object, which contains a value and a done property
    </li>
    <li>
        Replaces the return of a function to suspend its execution without destroying local variables
    </li>
    <li>
        Code written after the yield statement executes in the next function call
    </li>
  </ul>
    </section>

        <p>Here's a brief overfiew of these concepts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Iterable:</strong> An iterable is an object that has an associated function, usually 
                named <strong>'[Symbol.iterator]'</strong>, which returns an iterator. Arrays, strings, sets, and 
                maps are examples of built-in iterables in TypeScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Iterator:</strong> An iterator is an object that provides a <strong>next</strong> method, 
                which, when called, returns an object with two properties: <strong>'value'</strong> (the next 
                value in the sequence) and <strong>'done'</strong> (a boolean indicating if the iteration is complete).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To work with iterators in TypeScript, you typically use <strong>'for...of'</strong> loops. These 
            loops can iterate over any iterable, making it easy to work with various collections.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's an example of how iterators are used in TypeScript:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>

const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
const iterator = numbers[Symbol.iterator]();  //Get an iterator 

for (const num of iterator){
    console.log(num); // Outputs: 1,2,3,4,5
}
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            In this example, we obtain an iterator from the array numbers using the [Symbol.iterator] function. Then, we use a for...of loop to iterate over the elements of the array, and the iterator handles the sequence and access to each element.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
<pre>
    <code>
        class Range implements Iterable&lt;number&gt;{
            private start: number;
            privat end: number;

            constructor(start: number, end: number){
                this.start = start;
                this.end = end;
            }

            //this allows us to iterate over the class
            *[Symbol.iterator](): Generator&lt;number&gt;{
                for (let i = this.start; i &lt;= this.end; i++){
                    yield i;
                }
            }
        }

        const range = new Range(1,5);
        for(const num of range){
            console.log(num);
        }
    </code>

        <h2>Code example:</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine you have a music playlist, and you want to play each song one by one. You can use an 
            iterator to handle the iteration through the playlist. Here's a TypeScript code example:
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        class Playlist {
            prive songs: string[];
            private currentIndex: number;

            constructor(){
                this.songs = ["Song 1", "Song 2", "Song 3", "Song 4", "Song 5"];
                this.currentIndex = 0;
            }

            *[Symbol.iterator](): Generator&lt;object&gt; {
                return {
                    next: () => {
                        if (this.currentIndex &lt; this.songs.length){
                            const song = this.songs[this.currentIndex];
                            this.currentIndex++;

                            return {value: song, done: false};
                        } else {
                            return {done: true};
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        const playList = new Playlist();

        for (const song of playList){
            console.log(`Now playing: ${song}`)
        }
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            In this example, we have a <strong>'Playlist'</strong> class that represents a collection of songs. The 
            <strong>'[Symbol.iterator]`</strong> method defines an iterator for the playlist. It returns an object with 
            a <strong>'next'</strong> method that, when called, provides the next song and updates the <strong>'currentIndex'</strong>. 
            <br>
            We use a <strong>'for...of'</strong> loop to play each song from the playlist.

        <h2>Assignment: Library</h2>
        <p>
            Imagine you have a library of books, each with different genres, and you want to create an iterator to go 
            through the books in each genre. Create a TypeScript program that models this situation. You should define a class for the library, 
            a way to add books of various genres, and an iterator to go through books of a specific genre.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's the assignment in pseudo-code:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a <strong>"Library"</strong> class.</li>
            <li>
                Implement a method to add books to the library. Each book should have a title, author and genre.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement an iterator for a specific genre. This iterator should allow you to iterate through all books of that genre in the library.
            </li>
            <li>
                Demonstrate how to use the iterator to access and display books of a specific genre from the library.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    
    <footer>
        Iterators offer a way to traverse the elements of a collection one by one.
        The purpose of iterators is to provide a standard way for accessing and
        iterating over collections, such as arrays or maps, in a language-agnostic
        way. Using iterators, you can iterate over collections in a loop without
        having to worry about the underlying implementation of the collection.
