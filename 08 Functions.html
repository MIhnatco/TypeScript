        <h1>Functions</h1>
        <p>
            Functions are a fundamental building block of any application in TypeScript, as they are in JavaScript.
            They allow you to build up layers of abstraction, mimicking classes, information hiding, and modules.

        <h2>Program</h2>
        <p>
            In computer science, a program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem

            When a program runs, it executes a set of steps and those steps are coded by the programmer. Some programs 
            may be simple with only a few steps and others may be complex with many steps. Regardless of how complex a 
            program is, we should be able to organize it. And here come 'functions' in.

            A <strong>function</strong> is the most basic organizational unit of a program. Functions can 
            perform nay number of actions and they can contain anything. They can have a single boolean 
            expression or they have complex logic for reading programming. <strong>Functions</strong> allow 
            us to encapsulate logic into a single package. And once that logic is encapsulated within 
            the function, it can be reused anywhere else in the program. This makes it easier to read, to write 
            and to test your code.
        </p>
        <p>
            For function to do something, it requires some data. To specify what the function works with, we use something 
            called <strong>parameters</strong>. Functions can have any number of <strong>paramters</strong>, although it's 
            best to limite thme to a five or less. <br>
            Let's take an example of how functions work. Here we have a function that requires a color, a sound and a word. <br>
            To execut the code withing a function, we have to call it.
        </p>

        <p>
            When calling a function, we need to provide data for the parameters. When data is provided for function, 
            we call the data arguments to the function. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When we call a fuction, both parties can exchange information. The caller provides information using 
            arguments and they call the function and then the function is able to return data back to the caller. 
            It's important to note that when functions are called the correct argumetns must be supplied. If we 
            provide the arguments in the wrong order...then we'll get an error. 
        </p>

            The great thing about TypeScript is that all these checks will be happening as you're writing your code, 
            so you'll know rigth away.

        <h3>Mnemonic Devices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Think of a function as a recipe: it takes ingredients (parameters), performs a set of instructions (code), 
                and produces a dish (return value).
            </li>
            <li>
                The function keyword is like the title of the recipe, and the parameters are the ingredients listed in the recipe.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In summary, a program in computer science is a set of instructions written in a programming 
            language that a computer follows to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. <br>
             Functions are an essential component of programming that help organize code
            and make it more modular. A function is a block of code that can be called
            multiple times throughout a program with different inputs, allowing you to
            reuse code and save time. Functions can perform specific tasks or return
            values, and they can be used to break down complex problems into smaller,
            more manageable pieces. By using functions, you can reduce redundancy,improve code readability, and make it easier to maintain and update your code
