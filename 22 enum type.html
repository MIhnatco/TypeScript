        <h1>enum type</h1>
        <p>
            In TypeScript, an <strong>'enum'</strong> (short for 'enumeration') is a data type used to define 
            a set of named constants, which represents a set ofo related values. Enums make your code more readable, 
            and self-documenting by providing meaningful names for values, rather than using raw number or strings. They 
            are particularly useful when you have a fixed and well-defined set of options or values.
        </p>

        <h2>Definig an Enum:</h2>
        <p>
            To define an <strong>'enum'</strong>, use the <strong>'enum'</strong> keyword followed by a name 
            for the enum and a set of named constants enclosed in curly braces. Each constant should have a name 
            and an optional associated value. The associated value can be of any type (number or string).
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        enum Days {
            Sunday,   //0
            Monday,   //1
            Tuesday,  //2
            Wednesday,  //3
            Thursday,   //4
            Friday,     //5
            Saturday    //6
        }
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            In the example above, we've defined an enum named <strong>"Days"</strong> with seven named constants. By 
            default, each constant is assigned a numeric value starting from 0, and subsequent values are incremented by 1.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Using an Enum:
        </h2>
        <p>
            You can use the enum in your code to represent values and provide meaningful names. For example:
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        let today: Days = Days.Wednesday;
        console.log("Today is " + today);   //Output: Today is 3
    </code>
</pre>

        <h2>Reverse Mapping:</h2>
        <p>
            Enums in TypeScript support reverse mapping, which means you can convert from a numeric 
            value or string to the corresponding enum member name. For example:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        let dayName: string = Days[3]; //This returns "Wednesday"
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            This is particularly useful when you need to display or work with human-readable names based on 
            enum values.
        </p>


        <h2>Custom Values for enum members:</h2>
        <p>You can also assign custom values to enum members:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        enum Color {
            Red = "#f00",
            Green = "#0f0", 
            Blue = "#00f"
        }
    </code>
</pre>

        <p>
            Here, we've defined an enum <strong>"Color"</strong> with custom string values representing color codes.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Reverse mapping</strong> is primarily designed for use with numeric <strong>enum</strong> values and may not work as expected with custom values 
            for <strong>enum</strong> members. When you have custom values for enum members, TypeScript doesn't generate a <strong>reverse mapping</strong> from values to member names automatically. 
            Instead, <strong>reverse mapping</strong> is primarily applicable when using the default incremental numeric values.
        </p>

        <h2>Use cases for Enums:</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Enums</strong> are commonly used whne you have a set of options or categories, that need 
            to be represented in your code, such as days of the week, colors, status codes, or error types. They 
            provide a structured and type-safe way to work with these values. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Enums</strong> help prevent accidental misuse of values and improve code quality by making 
            it clear what each value represents. They also enhance code maintainability and readability.
