        <h1>Increment & Arithmetic Assignment</h1>
        <p>
            Incrementing numbers is a common task to perform when writing programs. So
            common that there is an operator dedicated to just incrementing numbers. <br>
            However, it does come with a few caveats to be aware of.

        <h2>Increment and Decrement Operators:</h2>
        <p>
            TypeScript provides two operators for incrementing and decrementing variables:
        </p>

        <h3>Postfix Increment:</h3>
        <p>
            In postfix increment, the ++ operator is placed after the variable. 
            The increment operation is performed after the current value is used or evaluated.

        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
let a = 10;
let b = a++;
// Now, a is 11, but b is 10 (the previous value of a)

    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    In this example, the current value of a is assigned to b before a is incremented. 
    So, a ends up with the value 11, but b retains the previous value of a, which is 10.
</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Increment (++): Adds 1 to the variable's value.

                </figure>
            </li>
            <li>
                Decrement (--): Subtracts 1 from the variable's value.
            </li>
        </ul>

<pre>
    <code>
let count = 5;
count++; // Increment count to 6
count--; // Decrement count to 5
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            You can use these operators both as pre-increment and post-increment. 
            Pre-increment increases the value before its use, and post-increment increases the value after its use.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Prefix Increment:

        </h3>
        <p>
            In prefix increment, the ++ operator is placed before the variable. 
            The increment operation is performed before the value is used or evaluated.

        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
    let x = 5;
let y = ++x;
// Now, x is 6, and y is also 6

    </code>
</pre>
            <p>
                In this example, the value of x is incremented before its value is assigned to y. So, both x and y end up with the value 6.
            </p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/prefix.png" alt="">
        </figure>

<pre>
    <code>
let x = 10;
let y = ++x; // Now x and y are both 11
    </code>
</pre>

        <h2>Arithmetic Assignment Operators:</h2>
        <p>
            TypeScript provides shorthand operators that combine arithmetic operations with assignment:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Add and Assign (+=): Adds a value to the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Subtract and Assign (-=): Subtracts a value from the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multiply and Assign (*=): Multiplies the variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide and Assign (/=): Divides the variable by a value and assigns the result to the variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Modulo and Assign (%=): Calculates the remainder and assigns it to the variable.
            </li>
        </ul>

<pre>
    <code>
let total = 10;
total += 5; // total is now 15
total -= 3; // total is now 12
total *= 2; // total is now 24
total /= 4; // total is now 6
total %= 5; // total is now 1
    </code>
</pre>
    </article>

        <h5>Mnemonic Devices:</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Think of the increment and decrement operators as quick shortcuts for adding or subtracting 1 from a variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Both prefix and postfix increment increase the variable's value by 1. <br>
                
                The difference is in the order of operations: prefix increments before using the value, while postfix increments after using the value.
            </li>

        </ul>

Arithmetic assignment operators are like a combination of arithmetic operations and variable assignment, allowing you to perform operations and update a variable's value in a single step.
