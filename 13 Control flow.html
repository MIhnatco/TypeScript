        <p>
            Conditional statements in TypeScript allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
             These statements help your program make decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>The 'if' statement</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>'if'</strong> statement is one of the most fundamental conditional statements in TypeScript. 
            It allows you to execute a block of code if a specified condition is <strong>'true'</strong>.
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        let age = 18;
        if (age >= 18){
            console.log("You are an adult.")
        }
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            In this example, the  code inside the <strong>'if'</strong> block will only run if the condition 
            <strong>'age >= 18'</strong> is true.
        </p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>The 'else' statement</h2>
        <p>
            You can use the <strong>'else'</strong> statement to provide an alternative code block to run if the 
            <strong>'if'</strong> condition is <strong>'false'</strong>.
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        let temperature = 25;
        if (temperature > 30){
            console.log("It's hot outside.")
        } else {
            console.log("It's not too ht outside.")
        }
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            In this example, if the temperature is greater than 30, the first message is displayed. Otherwise, 
            the message in the <strong>'else'</strong> block is shown.
        </p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h2>The 'else if' statement</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>'else if'</strong> statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check in a controlled 
            and organized manner. It comes after the initial <strong>'if'</strong> statement and before the 
            optional <strong>'else'</strong> statement.
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        let score = 75

        if (score >= 90){
            console.log("You got an A.")
        } else if (score >= 80){
            console.log("You got a B.")
        } else if (score >= 70){
            console.log("You got a C.")
        } else {
            console.log("You need to improve your score.")
        }
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            In this example, the code will check the score against multiple conditions. If the score is greater than or equal to 90, it prints 
            "You got an A." If not, it moves to the next else if block and checks if the score is greater than or equal to 80, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
            The else if statement allows you to create a chain of conditions that are evaluated in order. 
            As soon as one condition is met, the corresponding block of code is executed, and the remaining conditions are skipped.
        </p>

        <h2>Comparison operators</h2>
        <p>Comparison operators such as ==, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, and &gt;= are used to compare values in conditions.</p>

        <h3>Equality Operators == & ===</h3>
        <p>
            There are two operators for checking equality in Typescript. One is (==) known as an equality operator or loose equality operator. 
            The other one is (===) strict Equality operator.
        </p>


        <h3>
            Not Equal Operators != & !==
        </h3>
        <p>
            != operator checks the un equality of two operands. It is similar to == except it returns true if operands are not equal. !== operator is similar to === except it returns true if operands are not equal.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Less than (&lt;)
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Less than (&lt;) comparison operator checks if the left operand is less than its right operand. 
            If yes then it returns true otherwise returns false
        </p>

        <h3>Greater than (&gt;)</h3>
        <p>
            The greater than &gt; operator checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the right operator. 
            If yes then it returns true else false.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Less than or equal (&lt;=)
        </h3>
        <p>
            The less than or equal (&lt;=) operator returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to its right operand. else it evaluates to false.
        </p>
        <h3>Greater than or equal (&gt;=)</h3>
        <p>
            The Greater than or equal (&gt;=) relational operator returns true if its left operand is greater than or equal to its right operand else it returns false.
        </p>


<pre>
    <code>
let x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
  // Code to execute if x is greater than 5.
}

console.log(x &lt;= 20)    //true
console.log(x &lt;= 15)    //true
console.log(x &lt;= 10)    //true
console.log(x &lt;= 5)     //false

console.log(x >= 20)    //false
console.log(x >= 15)    //false
console.log(x >= 10)    //true
console.log(x >= 5)     //true

        <h2>Logical operators</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Logical operators</strong> are used to combine two or more conditions. <strong>Logical operators</strong> 
            retun a Boolean value. <br>
            Assume the value of variable A is 10 and B is 20.

                <td>
                    (A > 10 || B > 10) is True

                <td>
                    !(A > 10) is True

       <h2>Short-circuit Operators (&& and ||)</h2>
       <p>
           The <strong>&&</strong> and <strong>||</strong> operators are used to combine expressions. 
           The <strong>&&</strong> operator returns true only when both the conditions return true. Let us consider an expression âˆ’

       </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        var a = 10 
        var result = ( a<10 && a>5)

    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    In the above example, a < 10 and a > 5 are two expressions combined by an && operator. Here, the first expression returns false. However, the && operator requires both the expressions return true. So, the operator skips the second expression.
</p>


    <p>The <strong>||</strong> operator returns true, if one of the expressions returns true. For example:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        var a = 10 
        var result = ( a &lt; 5 || a &gt;10)
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            In the above snippet, two expressions a &gt; 5 and a &lt; 10 are combined by a <strong>||</strong> operator. Here, the first expression returns true. Since, the first expression returns true, the || operator skips the subsequent expression and returns true.

        </p>
        <p>
            Due to this behavior of the && and || operator, they are called as <strong>short-circuit operators</strong>.

       <h3>Mnemonic Devices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Think of the <strong>if</strong> statement as a gatekeeper: it lets code through only if a certain condition is met.
            </li>
            <li>
                The else statement is the backup plan for when the if condition is not satisfied.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Here are a few key points to keep in mind when using else if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Conditions are evaluated from top to bottom. Once a condition is true, the associated block of code is executed, and the rest of the else if and else blocks are skipped.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can have multiple <strong>'else if'</strong> blocks, creating a hierarchy of conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can have an <strong>else</strong> block at the end to provide a default action in case none of the conditions are met.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <strong>else if</strong> statement is an effective way to handle complex decision-making scenarios and offers a structured approach to handling various cases in your code.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These statements are essential for building programs that can make decisions and respond to different situations.
