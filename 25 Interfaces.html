        <h1>Interfaces</h1>
        <p><strong>Interfaces</strong> allow you to define the structure and contract for objects in you code, making it 
            easier to work with complex dat types and ensure type safety.  
        </p>

        <h2>What are Interfaces?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Interfaces</strong> are a way to define the shape or structure of objects.
            </li>
            <li>
                They describe the contract that an object must adhere to.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Defining and using Interfaces:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                You can define interfaces using the <strong>'interface'</strong> keyword in TypeScript.
            </li>
            <li>
                Interfaces can include properties, methods, and even optional members.
            </li>
            <li>
                Interfaces can be used to define the structure of object literals or class instances.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Here's an example of how you can use an <strong>interface</strong> in TypeScript with an object:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
//Define an interface for a User object
interface User {
    id: number;
    username: string;
    email: string;
}

//Create an object hat adheres to the User interface
const user1: User = {
    id: 1,
    username: "John Doe", 
    email: "john@example.com"
}

const user2: User = {
    id: 2,
    username: "Jane Smith", 
    email: "jane@example.com"
}

//function that accepts a User object 
function displayUser(user: User){
    console.log(`User ID: ${user.id}`);
    console.log(`Username: ${user.username}`)
    constole.log(`Email: ${user.email}`)
}

//Display user information
displayUser(user1)
displayUser(user2)

    </code>
</pre>

    <p>In this example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We define an <strong>"User"</strong> interface with three properties: <strong>'id'</strong>, 
            <strong>'username'</strong> and <strong>'email'</strong>. This <strong>interface</strong> specifies 
            the structure that objects representing users should adhere to.
        </li>

        <li>We create two objects, <strong>user1</strong> and <strong>user2</strong>, that conform to the structure defined by the <strong>User</strong> interface. 
            Each object has an <strong>id</strong>, <strong>username</strong>, and <strong>email</strong>.</li>

        <li>The <strong>displayUser</strong> function takes a User object as a parameter and displays the user's information.</li>

        <li>We call the <strong>displayUser</strong> function with the user1 and user2 objects, demonstrating how 
            TypeScript enforces the object structure defined by the User interface.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Interface Properties and Methods:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Interfaces</strong> can include properties with data types and methods with function signatures.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can specify optional properties using the <strong>'?'</strong> modifier.
        </li>
    </ul>

<pre>
    <code>
//Define an interface for a Person
interface IPerson {
    //Properties with data types 
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    age: number;

    //Method with a function signatures
    getFullName(): string;
}

//Implement a class that adheres to the IPerson interface
    class Person implements IPerson {
        constructor( public firstName: string, public lastName: string, public age: number){
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
            this.age = age;
        }

        //Implement the method specified by the interface
        getFullName(): string {
            return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
        }
    }

//Create an instance of the Person class
const person = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);

//Access properteis and call the method
console.log(`First Name: ${person.firstName}`);
console.log(`Last Name: ${person.lastName}`);
console.log(`Age: ${person.age}`);
console.log(`Full Name: ${person.getFullName()}`);

    </code>
</pre>

<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We define an <strong>IPerson</strong> interface that includes three properties (firstName, lastName, and age) with their respective data types and one method (getFullName) with a function signature specifying its return type.
    </li>
    <li>
        We implement a <strong>Person </strong>class that adheres to the <strong>IPerson</strong> interface. The class includes properties that match the interface properties and implements the getFullName method, as required by the interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        We create an instance of the Person class and demonstrate how to access the properties and call the method defined in the interface.
    </li>
</ul>

        <p>
            This example illustrates how <strong>interfaces</strong> can define a structure that includes both 
            data properties and methods, helping ensure that classes adhere to a specific contract.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Optional properties</h2>
        <p>
            One usefule feature of TypeScript is the ability to specify <strong>optional properties</strong> in 
            interfaces and classes, allowing you to define an object type that may or may not have certain properties. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We can specify <strong>optional properties</strong> in interfaces and classes by the use of question mark <strong>'?'</strong> 
            symbol after the property name.
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
//Define na interface for a book
interface IBook {
    title: string;
    author: string;
    publishedYear?: number;  //Optional property
}

//create objects that adhere to the Book interface
const book1: IBook = {
    title: "The Great Gatsby", 
    author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald", 
    publishedYear: 1925
}

const book2: IBook = {
    title: "To Kill a Mockingbird", 
    author: "Harper Lee"
    //The 'publishedYear' property is optional and may be omitted
}

//function to display book information 
function displayBookInfo(book: IBook){
    console.log(`Title: ${book.title}`);
    console.log(`Author: ${book.author}`);

    if(book.publishedYear){
        console.log(`Published Year: ${book.publishedYear}`);
    }else {
        console.log('Published Year: N/A')
    }
}

//Display information for  the books 
console.log("Book 1:")
displayBookInfo(book1)

console.log("Book 2:")
displayBookInfo(book2)
    </code>
</pre>

        <p>This example demonstrates how you can use optional properties in interfaces to allow 
            flexibility when working with objects, allowing certain properties to be present or omitted.

            <strong>Type annotations</strong> and <strong>interfaces</strong> are both used in TypeScript for different 
            purposes, and they have some key differences:
        </p>

        <div class="container">
            <div>
                <h3>Type Annotations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A type annotation is a way to specify the data type of a variable, function parameter, or return value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Type annotations are often used to declare the data type of a specific value or entity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They are used to define the type of a single variable or value;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Type annotations can be simple, like <strong>'number'</strong>, <strong>'string'</strong> or 
                        more complex, like custom types or unions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Type annotations are especially useful for defining the type of function parameters or the 
                        return type of functions.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                    <h3>Interface:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An interface is a way to define a contract for the shape or structure of objects.</li>
                        <li>Interfaces are typically used to define the structure that objects should adhere to, 
                            specifying the properties they must have.

                        <li>
                            They are used to create a bluepring for objects, defining their properties and methods.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Interfaces are used to describe the structure of object literals, class instances, and custom types.

                        <li>
                            Interfaces can include properties, methods, and optional members.

        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Type annotations</strong> are primarily concerned with specifying data types for variables, parameters, 
                and return values, while <strong>interfaces</strong> are concerned with defining the structure of objects.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Type annotations</strong> are used to declare the type of specific values, while <strong>interfaces</strong> describe

            </li>
            <li>
                You can use <strong>interfaces</strong> to create reusable type contracts, making your code more maintainable

        <h2>Assignment 2: Building a Student Grading System</h2>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>
            You are tasked with building a student grading system for a school. Each student has the 
            following information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                name
            </li>
            <li>
                Student Id
            </li>
            <li>
                List of test scores (an array of numbers)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            You need to design TypeScript interfaces and class to model this system and implement the following 
            functionality:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Create an interface Student that defines the structure of a student object.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It should have properties for name, studentId, and testScores.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The testScores property is an array of numbers.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a class StudentRecord that implements the Student interface.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The class should have a constructor that accepts the name and studentId as parameters and initializes 
                        the testScores array as an empty array.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement a method <strong>'addTestScore(score: number)'</strong> that allows adding test 
                        scores to the <strong>'testScores'</strong> array.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement a method <strong>'getAverageTestScore()'</strong> that calculates and returns the average 
                        test score for the student.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement a method addTestScore(score: number) that allows adding test scores to the testScores array.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement a method getAverageTestScore() that calculates and returns the average test score for the student.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an array of StudentRecord instances to represent multiple students.
            </li>
            <li>
                Display the student information and their average test scores.
            </li>
        </ol>

       <h3>Instructions:</h3>
       <ul>
            <li>
                Create the TypeScript interface Student.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implement the StudentRecord class according to the Student interface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create at least three instances of the StudentRecord class to represent different students.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add test scores for each student using the addTestScore method.
            </li>
            <li>
                Calculate and display the average test scores for each student using the getAverageTestScore method.
            </li>
        
       </ul>
        <p>
            This assignment will require you to use interfaces, classes, methods, and arrays to model and manage student records and their test scores. It's a practical exercise that reflects a real-world scenario.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <h3>Type Checking and Type Safety:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Interfaces provide type checking, helping catch type-related errors at compile time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Interfaces promote type safety by clearly defining the expected object structure.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Type annotations </strong> help ensure that individual values ahve the correct data type, while 
            <strong>interfaces</strong> define the structure of more complex data, such as objects and classes.
