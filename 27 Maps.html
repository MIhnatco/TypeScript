        <h1>Data Structure: Map</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Maps</strong> are a data structure that stores key-value paris, providing efficinet data retrieval.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each 'key' in a Map is unique, and it maps to a specifi value.
            </li>
            <li>
                They differ from regular objects by allowing any data type as keys and maintaining key order.
            </li>
            <li>
                Unlike regural objects, <strong>Maps</strong> can use a wide range of data types as keys, 
                including objects, functions, and primitive values like strings and numbers.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </header>
    <section>
        <h2>How Maps differ from Objects:</h2>
        <p>While regular JavaScript objects can also store key-value pairs, Maps have several advantages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Keys can be of various data types, making Maps more flexible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Map keys maintain their insertion order, which means the order in which you add key-value pairs is preserved.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maps are more suitable for scenarios where you need to associate data and perform key-based operations efficiently.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Characteristics of Maps:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Keys in a Map are unique. If you add the same key multiple times, it will only store the latest associated value.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maps provide methods to add, access, and manipulate key-value pairs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Maps maintain the insertion order of keys, which is beneficial for certain operations.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Adding Key-Value Pairs:</h3>
        <p>
            You can add 'key-value' pairs to a Map using <strong>'set(key,value)'</strong> method. <br>
            Here's how it works:
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        type Name = string;
        type Score = number;

        const testScores: Map&lt;Name, Score&gt; = new Map()

        testScores.set("Alice", 96);
        testScores.set("Bob", 88);
        testScores.set("Carol", 92);


//To find out the size of the Map 
console.log(testScores.size)  //Output: 3
    </code>
</pre>

        <h3>Accessing Values by Keys:</h3>
        <p>
            To retrieve the value associated with a specific key, you can use the <strong>'get(key)'</strong> method:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
const Alice's score = testScores.get('Alice')
const Bob's score = testScores.get('Bob')
const Carol's score = testScores.get('Carol')
    </code>
</pre>

        <h3>Updating Key-Value Pairs:</h3>
        <p>
            If you want to update the value associated with an existing key, you can use the 
            <strong>'set'</strong> method again with the same key. This will replace the old value 
            with the new one:
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
testScores.set("Alice", 99);  //Updates the 'Alice' value to 99
    </code>
</pre>
    <p>The key remains the same, but the value is updated.</p>

    <h3>Adding multiple key-value pairs at once:</h3>
    <p>
        You can initialize a Map with multiple key-value pairs by passing an iterable, such as an array 
        of arrays containing key-value pairs:
    </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        const myMap = new Map([
            ['name', "Alice"], 
            ['age', 25], 
            ['city', "New York"]
        ])
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>This creates a Map with three key-value pairs.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Handling Non-existent keys:</h3>
        <p>
            When attempting to access a key that does not exist in the Map, the <strong>'get'</strong> method 
            returns <strong>'undefined'</strong>. It's a good practice to check if a key exists in the Map before 
            attempting to access it.
        </p>

        <p>
            To check if the 'key' exists in a Map() we can use <strong>'has'</strong> method:
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        myMap.has('age')
    </code>
</pre>
        
            <h3>Deleting key-value pairs</h3>
            <p>To remove a key-value pair from a Map, you can use the <strong>'delete(key)'</strong> method:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        myMap.delete("age");   //Deletes the 'age' key-value pair
    </code> 
</pre>

        <h3>Reset the Map</h3>
        <p>The <strong>'Map.clear()'</strong> method is used to remove all key-value pairs from a Map, 
            effectively emptying it. This method does not return any value, and it operates directly on the Map, 
            modifying it in place.
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        myMap.clear()
    </code>
</pre>
        
    </section>

        <h2>Iterating over Maps</h2>
        <h3>Using 'for...of' loop:</h3>
        <p>TypeScript provides a convenient way to iterate over the key-value pairs in a Map using the <strong>for...of</strong> loop. <br>
             Here's how it works:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        const myMap = new Map([
    ["name", "Alice"],
    ["age", 25],
    ["city", "New York"],
]);

for (const [key, value] of myMap) {
    console.log(`Key: ${key}, Value: ${value}`);
}
    </code>
</pre>

        <h3>Using the forEach Method:</h3>
        <p>
            Maps have a <strong>forEach</strong> method that can be used to iterate over the key-value pairs. It takes a callback function as an argument:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        myMap.forEach((value, key) => {
            console.log(`Key: ${key}, Value: ${value}`);
        });

    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            The <strong>forEach</strong> method iterates through the Map and invokes the provided callback function for each key-value pair.
        </p>
    
    
                <h3>Iterating Over Keys and Values Separately:</h3>
                <p>
                    If you need to iterate over keys or values alone, you can do so using the keys() and values() methods of the Map. For example:
                </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        for (const key of myMap.keys()) {
            console.log(`Key: ${key}`);
        }
        for (const value of myMap.values()) {
            console.log(`Value: ${value}`);
        }

    </code>
</pre>
        <h3>Iterating Over Entries:</h3>

        <p>
            The entries() method returns an iterable of key-value pairs, making it similar to the default behavior of the for...of loop. For example:
        </p>

        
<pre>
    <code>
        for (const [key, value] of myMap.entries()) {
            console.log(`Key: ${key}, Value: ${value}`);
        }
    </code>
</pre>
       <p>
           You can use Map iteration to perform various tasks, such as filtering data, searching for specific values, or transforming the data as needed.
       </p>
