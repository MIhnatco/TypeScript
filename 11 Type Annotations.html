      <h1>Type Annotations</h1>
      <p>
        Type annotations in TypeScript are used to explicitly specify types for
        variables, functions, objects, and more. They are not mandatory in
        TypeScript, but they help the compiler in checking types and avoiding
        errors when dealing with data types.
      </p>
    </header>

    <article>
      <strong>Type annotations</strong> are declared using a colon (:) followed
      by the name of the type, and they come after the name of the construct
      they're declaring the type for
      <pre>
    <code>
        let age: number = 30;  //Age is explicitly annotated as a number.
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>Here are some key points about type annotations in TypeScript:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They help catch JavaScript errors by enforcing type checking.</li>
        <li>
          They can be used to specify the type of variables, function
          parameters, and object properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once an identifier is annotated with a type, it can be used as that
          type only. If the identifier is used as a different type, the
          TypeScript compiler will issue an error.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type annotations can be used for primitive data types such as number,
          string, and boolean.
        </li>
        <li>
          They can also be used for more complex types such as arrays and
          objects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type annotations can be used to specify the return type of functions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Basic Type Annotations for variables:</h2>
      <p>
        You can use type annotations when declaring variables to specify their
        data type.
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code>
        let name: string = 'Alice';
        let isActive: boolean = true;
        let counter: number = 5;
        const powerLevel: bigint = 9000n + 1n;
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>
        You cannot change the value using a different data type other than the
        declared data type of a variable. If you try to do so, TypeScript
        compiler will show an error. This helps in catching JavaScript errors.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you assign a string to the counter variable, you'll get an error:
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code>
        let counter: number;
        counter = 'Hello'; // compile error  Type '"Hello"' is not assignable to type 'number'.

    </code>
</pre>

      <h2>Type Annotations for function parameters and return values</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Type Annotations</strong> can be applied to function parameters
        and return values, ensuring that the function accepts and produces the
        correct data types.
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code>
        function add(a: number, b: number): number {
            return a + b
        }
    </code>
</pre>
      <p>
        Here, the parameters must be numbers...and the third "number" word,
        shows, that return from this function must be a number as well.
        <br />
        TypeScript will verify that the function is called with the correct
        types of arguments and will enforce the return type.
      </p>

      <p>
        In TypeScript, the <strong>'void'</strong> type is used to indicate that
        a function does not return any value.
      </p>
      <pre>
    <code>
        function add(a: number, b: number): void {
            a + b //No return statement
        }
    </code>
</pre>
      <p>
        If the intention of the function is to perform an operation without
        returning a value, you can keep the
        <strong>'void'</strong> return type but remove the
        <strong>return</strong> statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The choice between these options depends on the intended behavior of
        your function. If the function is meant to perform a calculation and
        return a result, use type of variable, that should be returned. It it's
        meant to perform an operation without returning a value, use
        <strong>'void'</strong> return type.
      </p>

      <h2>Type Annotations for Arrays</h2>
      <p>
        Annotate an array type you use use a specific type followed by a square
        bracket : type[] :
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code>
let arrayName: type[];

    </code>
</pre>
      <p>For example, the following declares an array of strings:</p>
      <pre>
    <code>
        let names: string[] = ['John', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'David', 'Mary'];
    </code>
</pre>
      <p>The following declares an array of numbers:</p>
      <pre>
    <code>
        let myArray: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>
        In the examples above, we have annotated 'names' as an array of strings
        and 'myArray' as an array of numbers.
      </p>

      <h2>Type Annotations for objects.</h2>
      <p>
        In <strong>TypeScript</strong>, you can use type annotations to specify
        the structure and types of the properties within an object. You can
        define a type that represents the shape of an object and then annotate
        the object with that type.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's how you can add type annotations for the you object in your code:
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code>
        let myObject: { name: string, age: number } = {
            name: "John Doe", 
            age: 24
        }

    </code>
</pre>

      <p>
        Type annotations can be used throughout your TypeScript code to provide
        clarity and catch potential type-related errors. They also help with
        code documentation and improve tooling support, such as autocompletion
        and type checking in IDEs.
      </p>

      <h2>Type Inference</h2>
      <p>
        TypeScript can often infer the data type based on the value assigned to
        a variable. This means that you don't always have to explicitly annotate
        the types of variables, as TypeScript can infer them for you. This is
        known as <strong>type inference</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>Here's an example:</p>
      <pre>
 <code>
            
            let myNumber = 42; // TypeScript infers the type as number
            let myString = "Hello, TypeScript!"; // TypeScript infers the type as string
            let myBoolean = true; // TypeScript infers the type as boolean
          
        </code>
    </pre>
      <p>
        In this case, we haven't provided explicit type annotations for the
        variables myNumber, myString, and myBoolean. However, TypeScript
        automatically infers their types based on the assigned values.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type inference also works with function parameters and return types:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            function add(a: number, b: number) { 
                return a + b; // TypeScript infers the return type as number
             } 
                
            
            let result = add(2, 3); // TypeScript infers the type of result as number

        </code>
      </pre>
      <p></p>
      In this example, the function <strong>add</strong> doesn't have an
      explicit return type annotation. However, TypeScript is able to infer that
      the return type is number based on the fact that we are performing
      addition on two parameters of type number.
      <p>
        Type inference is a handy feature that can help reduce code verbosity
        and improve code readability. However, you can still provide explicit
        type annotations for clarity and to catch potentail errors.

      <h2>Assignment:</h2>
      <p>
        Create a TypeScript class called <strong>Person</strong> that represents
        a person's information. The <strong>Person</strong> class should have
        the following properties: name, age, email, and isStudent. The
        <strong>name</strong> and <strong>email</strong> properties should be of
        type string, the <strong>age</strong> property should be of type number,
        and the <strong>isStudent</strong> property should be of type boolean.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, create a method called <strong>haveBirthday</strong> in
        the <strong>Person</strong> class that increments the person's age by 1
        each time it is called.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your task is to implement the Person class in TypeScript, including the
        necessary type annotations for properties and methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've completed the code, create an instance of the Person class,
        test the haveBirthday method, and print the person's updated age to the
        console.
      </p>

      <h3>Mnemonic Devices:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Think of type annotations as labels that specify the data type of
          variables and functions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Type annotations</strong> in TypeScript, a feature that enhances
        type safety, improves code readability, and provides valuable
        documentation. <strong>Type annotations</strong> are crucial for
        building robust and maintainable TypeScript applications.
