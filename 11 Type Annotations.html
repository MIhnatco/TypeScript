        <h1>Type Annotations</h1>
        <p>
            Type annotations in TypeScript are used to explicitly specify types for variables, functions, objects, and more.
             They are not mandatory in TypeScript, but they help the compiler in checking types and avoiding errors when dealing with data types.
        </p>
</header>

<article>
        <strong>Type annotations</strong> are declared using a colon (:) followed by the name of the type, and they come after the name of the construct they're declaring the type for
<pre>
    <code>
        let age: number = 30;  //Age is explicitly annotated as a number.
    </code>
</pre>

    <p>Here are some key points about type annotations in TypeScript:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            They help catch JavaScript errors by enforcing type checking.
        </li>
        <li>
            They can be used to specify the type of variables, function parameters, and object properties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once an identifier is annotated with a type, it can be used as that type only. If the identifier is used as a different type, the TypeScript compiler will issue an error.
        </li>
        <li>
            Type annotations can be used for primitive data types such as number, string, and boolean.
        </li>
        <li>
            They can also be used for more complex types such as arrays and objects.
        </li>
        <li>
            Type annotations can be used to specify the return type of functions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Type Annotations for variables:</h2>
    <p>You can use type annotations when declaring variables to specify their data type.</p>
    
<pre>
    <code>
        let name: string = 'Alice';
        let isActive: boolean = true;
        let counter: number = 5;
        const powerLevel: bigint = 9000n + 1n;
    </code>
</pre>

        <p>
            You cannot change the value using a different data type other than the declared data type of a variable. 
            If you try to do so, TypeScript compiler will show an error. This helps in catching JavaScript errors. 
        </p>

        <p>If you assign a string to the counter variable, you'll get an error:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        let counter: number;
        counter = 'Hello'; // compile error  Type '"Hello"' is not assignable to type 'number'.

    </code>
</pre>

<h2>Type Annotations for function parameters and return values</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Type Annotations</strong> can be applied to function parameters and return values, ensuring that 
    the function accepts and produces the correct data types.
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        function add(a: number, b: number): number {
            return a + b
        }
    </code>
</pre>
    <p>
        Here, the parameters must be numbers...and the third "number" word, shows, that return from this function 
        must be a number as well.
    </p>



    <p>
        In TypeScript, the <strong>'void'</strong> type is used to indicate that a function does not return any value. 
    </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        function add(a: number, b: number): void {
            a + b //No return statement
        }
    </code>
</pre>
    <p>
        If the intention of the function is to perform an operation without returning a value, you can keep the 
        <strong>'void'</strong> return type but remove the <strong>return</strong> statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The choice between these options depends on the intended behavior of your function. If the function is meant to perform 
        a calculation and return a result, use type of variable, that should be returned. It it's meant to perform 
        an operation without returning a value, use <strong>'void'</strong> return type.
    </p>

    <h2>Type Annotations for Arrays</h2>
    <p>Annotate an array type you use use a specific type followed by a square bracket : type[] :</p>

<pre>
    <code>
let arrayName: type[];

    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            For example, the following declares an array of strings:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        let names: string[] = ['John', 'Jane', 'Peter', 'David', 'Mary'];
    </code>
</pre>



    <h2>Type Annotations for objects.</h2>
    <p>
        In <strong>TypeScript</strong>, you can use type annotations to specify the structure and types of the properties within an object. 
        You can define a type that represents the shape of an object and then annotate the object with that type.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's how you can add type annotations for the you object in your code:
    </p>

    <pre>
        <code>
    type Person = {
        name: string;
        age: number;
    };
    
    const person: Person  = {
        name: 'John',
        age: 25
    }; 
        </code>
    </pre>

<pre>
    <code>
        type User = {
          userName: {
            firstName: string;
            lastName: string;
          };
          isReturning: string;
        };
        
        const you: User = {
          userName: { firstName: 'Bobby', lastName: 'Brown' },
          isReturning: 'yes',
        };

    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            In this example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We define a User type that specifies the structure of the you object.
            </li>
            <li>
                Inside the User type, we describe the userName property as an object with firstName and lastName properties, both of type string.
            </li>
            <li>
                We also specify the isReturning property as a string.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            By adding these type annotations, you provide clear information to TypeScript about the expected structure and types of the you object, which can help catch type-related errors and provide better code documentation.
        </p>



















    <h2>Type Inference</h2>
    <p>
        TypeScript can often infer the data type based on the value assigned to a variable. This is known as <strong>type inference</strong>.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            let temperature = 25; //TypeScript infers that temperature is of type number
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        However, you can still provide explicit type annotations for clarity and to catch potentail errors.
    </p>

    <article>
        <h2> Union types and type aliases:</h2>
        <p>
            TypeScript supports more advance type annotations like 'union types' and type aliases.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Union Types: </strong> Allow a variable to have multiple possible types.
<pre>
    <code>
        let result: number || string = 42;
    </code>
</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Type Aliases:</strong> Let you create custom names for complex types, making your 
                code more readable. Type aliases in TypeScript are used to assign a name to any type,
                 making it easier to reuse throughout the code. <br>
                 They do not create a new type, but rather provide a name for an existing type.
                 To create a type alias, use the type keyword followed by the name of the alias and the type it refers to. <br>
                 Here are some examples:

                 <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Primitives:</strong> <strong>Type aliases</strong> can be used to name primitive types 
                        like <strong>'string'</strong>, <strong>'number'</strong>, <strong>'boolen'</strong>. For 
                        example: 
        <pre>
            <code>
                type myString = string
                type myNumber = number
                type isNew = boolean
            </code>
        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Unions:</strong> <strong>Type aliases</strong> can also be used to name union types. 
                        For example:
    <pre>
        <code>
            type myUnion = string || number;
        </code>
    </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Objects:</strong> <strong>Type aliases</strong> can be used to name object types. 
                        For example: 
    <pre>
        <code>
            type myObject = {
                name: string, 
                age: number
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
                    </li>
                 </ul>
<pre>
    <code>

        type myCountry = string;
        let country: myCountry = "USA";
        let alsoCountry: string = "Canada"

        


        type Point = { x: number; y: number};
        let origin: Point = {x: 0, y: 0}
    </code>
</pre>

To create a type alias, we're going to use the word <strong>type</strong>..In this case <code>type myCountry</code> and 
if we're seeing <strong>type myCountry</strong> anywhere in the code, we must ensure it is going to be a string no matter what. <br>
And this allows us to substitute these two for each other..So anywhere that requires a string we'll be able to use 'myCountry' and anywhere 
that requires 'myCountry' we'll be able to use a string. So as far as TypeScript is concerned, 'myCountry' is a string.
            </li>

            <li>
                By adding these type annotations, you provide clear information to TypeScript about the expected structure 
                and types of the you object, which can help catch type-related errors and provide better code documentation.
            </li>

            <li>
                Using Type aliases in action:
<pre>
    <code>
        //bad function 
        function print(country: string){
            console.log(`The country is: ${country}`)
        }

        // good function 
        function printCountry(countryName: myCountry){
            console.log(`The country is: ${countryName}`)
        }
    </code>
</pre>
            </li>
        </ul>

       <h3>Mnemonic Devices:</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>
            Think of type annotations as labels that specify the data type of variables and functions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Union types are like having a variable that can wear multiple hats, and type aliases are like giving names to complex structures for better organization.
        </li>
       </ul>

       <p>
        <strong>Type annotations</strong> in TypeScript, a feature that enhances type safety, improves code readability, and provides valuable documentation. 
        <strong>Type annotations</strong> are crucial for building robust and maintainable TypeScript applications.
