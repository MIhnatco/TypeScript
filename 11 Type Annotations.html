        <h1>Type Annotations</h1>
        <p>
            Type annotations in TypeScript are used to explicitly specify types for variables, functions, objects, and more.
             They are not mandatory in TypeScript, but they help the compiler in checking types and avoiding errors when dealing with data types.
        </p>

<article>
        <strong>Type annotations</strong> are declared using a colon (:) followed by the name of the type, and they come after the name of the construct they're declaring the type for
<pre>
    <code>
        let age: number = 30;  //Age is explicitly annotated as a number.
    </code>
</pre>

    <p>Here are some key points about type annotations in TypeScript:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            They help catch JavaScript errors by enforcing type checking.
        </li>
        <li>
            They can be used to specify the type of variables, function parameters, and object properties.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once an identifier is annotated with a type, it can be used as that type only. If the identifier is used as a different type, the TypeScript compiler will issue an error.
        </li>
        <li>
            Type annotations can be used for primitive data types such as number, string, and boolean.
        </li>
        <li>
            They can also be used for more complex types such as arrays and objects.
        </li>
        <li>
            Type annotations can be used to specify the return type of functions.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Basic Type Annotations for variables:</h2>
    <p>You can use type annotations when declaring variables to specify their data type.</p>
    
<pre>
    <code>
        let name: string = 'Alice';
        let isActive: boolean = true;
        let counter: number = 5;
        const powerLevel: bigint = 9000n + 1n;
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    You cannot change the value using a different data type other than the declared data type of a variable. 
    If you try to do so, TypeScript compiler will show an error. This helps in catching JavaScript errors. 
</p>

<h2>Type Annotations for function parameters and return values</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Type Annotations</strong> can be applied to function parameters and return values, ensuring that 
    the function accepts and produces the correct data types.
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        function add(a: number, b: number): number {
            return a + b
        }
    </code>
</pre>
    <p>
        Here, the parameters must be numbers...and the third "number" word, shows, that return from this function 
        must be a number as well.
    </p>



    <p>
        In TypeScript, the <strong>'void'</strong> type is used to indicate that a function does not return any value. 
    </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        function add(a: number, b: number): void {
            a + b //No return statement
        }
    </code>
</pre>
    <p>
        If the intention of the function is to perform an operation without returning a value, you can keep the 
        <strong>'void'</strong> return type but remove the <strong>return</strong> statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The choice between these options depends on the intended behavior of your function. If the function is meant to perform 
        a calculation and return a result, use type of variable, that should be returned. It it's meant to perform 
        an operation without returning a value, use <strong>'void'</strong> return type.
    </p>

    <h2>Type Inference</h2>
    <p>
        TypeScript can often infer the data type based on the value assigned to a variable. This is known as <strong>type inference</strong>.
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
            let temperature = 25; //TypeScript infers that temperature is of type number
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        However, you can still provide explicit type annotations for clarity and to catch potentail errors.
    </p>

        <h2> Union types and type aliases:</h2>
        <p>
            TypeScript supports more advance type annotations like 'union types' and type aliases.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Union Types: </strong> Allow a variable to have multiple possible types.
<pre>
    <code>
        let result: number || string = 42;
    </code>
</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Type Aliases:</strong> Let you create custom names for complex types, making your 
                code more readable.
<pre>
    <code>

        type myString = string;
        let country: myString = "USA";


        type Point = { x: number; y: number};
        let origin: Point = {x: 0, y: 0}
    </code>
</pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </article>

       <h3>Mnemonic Devices:</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>
            Think of type annotations as labels that specify the data type of variables and functions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Union types are like having a variable that can wear multiple hats, and type aliases are like giving names to complex structures for better organization.
        </li>
       </ul>

       <p>
        <strong>Type annotations</strong> in TypeScript, a feature that enhances type safety, improves code readability, and provides valuable documentation. 
        <strong>Type annotations</strong> are crucial for building robust and maintainable TypeScript applications.
