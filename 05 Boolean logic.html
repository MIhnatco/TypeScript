        <h1>Boolean Logic</h1>
        <p> <strong>Boolean logic</strong> is a fundamental concept that involves evaluating true/false statements.
             It is a system of logical thought that uses <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong> values to make deductions or draw conclusions. 
             <br> <strong>Boolean logic</strong> is used to
             express conditions and make decisions based on the truth or falsehood of these conditions.

        <h2>Boolean Data Type in TypeScript:</h2>
        <p>

            In TypeScript, the boolean data type represents two values: true and false. 
            Booleans are used to express binary logic and are fundamental to decision-making in programming.
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        let isRaining: boolean = true;
        let hasPermission: boolean = false;

    </code>
</pre>

        <h2>Logical Operators:</h2>
        <p>
            TypeScript provides several logical operators to work with boolean values:

        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
        OR (||): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
        NOT (!): Negates the value; if the operand is true, it becomes false, and vice versa.

        let sunny = true;
        let warm = true;
        let isSummer = false;
        
        let goingOutside = sunny && warm; // true
        let needACoat = !warm; // false
        let beachDay = sunny && (warm || isSummer); // true
    </code>

        <h2>Boolean Expressions:</h2>
        <p>
            Boolean expressions are combinations of variables, values, and logical operators that result in a boolean value. 
            They are used in decision-making and control flow in your programs.

        </p>


<pre>
    <code>
        let isWeekend = true;
        let hasHomework = false;
        
        if (isWeekend && !hasHomework) {
          console.log("Let's go have fun!");
        } else {
          console.log("Time to study.");
        }

        <h3>Exercises:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>Exercise 1: Sunny weekend decision</h5>
                You're planning your weekend activities. Write a TypeScript program that uses boolean variables 
                and logical operators to help you decide whether to go to the beach.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Create two boolean variables: <strong>'isSunny'</strong> and <strong>'isWeekend'</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>Use a boolean expression to determine whether you should go to the beach. You should consider 
                        going if it's sunny and it's the weekend.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Print a message that advises you on your decision
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h5>Exercise 2: Temperature Classifier</h5>
                Write a TypeScript program that classifies the temperature based 
                on the following rules:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the temperature is greater than or equal to 30 degrees, print "It's hot day!"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the temperature is between 20 and 29 degrees (inclusive), print "It's a nice day."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the temperature is below 20 degrees, print "It's a cold day."
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>Exercise 3: Eligibility Checher</h5>
                Your are building a program to check if a person is eligible to vote. 
                Create a TypeScript program that does the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Declare a variable <strong>'age'</strong> and assign it a value;
                    </li>
                    <li>Use a boolean expression to determine if the person is eligible to vote. 
                        In most countries, the minimum voting age is 18.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the person is eligible, print "You're eligible to vote.". If not, 
                        print "You are not eligible to vote."
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Test your program with different values of <strong>'age'</strong> to ensure it accurately 
                determines eligibility.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mnemonic Devices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Think of boolean expressions as questions or conditions. For example, "Is it sunny?" or "Do I have homework?"
            </li>
            <li>
                Logical operators are like the words that connect these questions: "AND" connects conditions that must both be true, "OR" connects conditions where at least one should be true, and "NOT" negates a condition.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These concepts are essential for building programs that can make informed choices based on different conditions.
