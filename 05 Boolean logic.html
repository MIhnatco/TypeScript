        <h1>Boolean Logic</h1>
        <p> <strong>Boolean logic</strong> is a fundamental concept that involves evaluating true/false statements.
             It is a system of logical thought that uses <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong> values to make deductions or draw conclusions. 
             <br> <strong>Boolean logic</strong> is used to
             express conditions and make decisions based on the truth or falsehood of these conditions.

        <h2>Boolean Data Type in TypeScript:</h2>
        <p>

            In TypeScript, the boolean data type represents two values: true and false. 
            Booleans are used to express binary logic and are fundamental to decision-making in programming.
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        let isRaining: boolean = true;
        let hasPermission: boolean = false;

    </code>

        <h2>Logical Operators:</h2>
        <p>
            TypeScript provides several logical operators to work with boolean values:

        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        AND (&&): Returns true if both operands are true.
        OR (||): Returns true if at least one operand is true.
        NOT (!): Negates the value; if the operand is true, it becomes false, and vice versa.

        let sunny = true;
        let warm = true;
        let isSummer = false;
        
        let goingOutside = sunny && warm; // true
        let needACoat = !warm; // false
        let beachDay = sunny && (warm || isSummer); // true
    </code>

        <h2>Boolean Expressions:</h2>
        <p>
            Boolean expressions are combinations of variables, values, and logical operators that result in a boolean value. 
            They are used in decision-making and control flow in your programs.

        </p>


<pre>
    <code>
        let isWeekend = true;
        let hasHomework = false;
        
        if (isWeekend && !hasHomework) {
          console.log("Let's go have fun!");
        } else {
          console.log("Time to study.");
        }

        <h3>Mnemonic Devices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Think of boolean expressions as questions or conditions. For example, "Is it sunny?" or "Do I have homework?"
            </li>
            <li>
                Logical operators are like the words that connect these questions: "AND" connects conditions that must both be true, "OR" connects conditions where at least one should be true, and "NOT" negates a condition.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These concepts are essential for building programs that can make informed choices based on different conditions.
