        <h1>Optional Fields</h1>
        <p>
            In <strong>TypeScript</strong>, you can declare fields in interfaces or object types as optional 
            by adding a <strong>'?'</strong> symbol after the field name. This indicates that the field may or 
            may not be present when creating objects of that type. <strong>Optional fields</strong> are useful 
            when you want to allow flexibility in the shape of objects without requiring every field to be provided.
        </p>

        <p>Here's a basic example of optional fields in TypeScript:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        interface Person {
            name: string;
            age?: number; //age is an optional field
        }

        const person1: Person = {
            name: "Alice"
        }

        const person2: Person = {
            name: 'Bob', 
            age: 25;
        }
    </code>
</pre>


<p>In this example, the <strong>Person</strong> interface defines two fields, <strong>name</strong> and <strong>age</strong>. 
    However, <strong>age</strong> is marked as optional with <strong>?</strong>. As a result:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You can create an object with only the name field (as shown in person1).
        </li>
        <li>
            You can also create an object with both name and age fields (as shown in person2).
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Assignment: User profile</h2>
        
        <p>Imagine you're developing a user profile system for a website. Users can create profiles with various pieces of information, 
            some of which are optional. 
            Your task is to create a TypeScript interface for a user profile that captures both required and optional fields.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Define an interface UserProfile that includes the following fields:
                <ul>
                    <li>username (a required string)</li>
                    <li>email (a required string)</li>
                    <li>age (an optional number)</li>
                    <li>location (an optional string)</li>
                    <li>bio (an optional string)</li>
                </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            Create a function printUserProfile that takes an argument of type <strong>UserProfile</strong> and prints the user's profile information.

        </li>
        <li>
            Create two user profiles, one with all required fields and another with some optional fields, and use the <strong>printUserProfile</strong> function to display their profiles.
        </li>
        <li>
            Handle the optional fields gracefully in the function so that it doesn't display anything for those fields if they are not provided.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Your solution should demonstrate the usage of optional fields in the <strong>UserProfile</strong> interface.

        Optional fields provide flexibility when dealing with objects that may not have all properties defined, which is common in real-world scenarios. They help you express this flexibility in the type system while still enforcing type safety where needed.
