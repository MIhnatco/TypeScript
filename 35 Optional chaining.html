      <h1>Optional chaining</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Optional Chaining</strong> is a feature in TypeScript that
        allows you to safely access properties or methods on objects without
        having to explicitly check if each property or method exists. It can
        help you prevent runtime errors that occur when you attempt to access
        properties or methods on null or undefined values.

      <code>
        <pre>
        interface Pii {
            age?: number;
            address?: string;
        }
    
        interface SearchResult {
            name: string;
            pii?: Pii;
        }
    
        class Database {
            search(name: string): SearchResult | undefined {
                switch(name){
                    case "John":
                        return {
                            name: "John Doe", 
                            pii: {
                                age: 22,
                            }
                        };
                    case "Jane":
                        return {
                            name: "Jane Doe"
                        }
                    default: 
                        return undefined;
                    
                }
    
            }
        }

    </pre
        >
      </code>

      <p>
        As you can see..we have multiple points where we can get 'undefined'.
        Here is code to test for 'undefined' for 'age'.
      </p>
      <pre>
    <code>
const database = new Database();

{
    const result = database.search("John")

    if (result !== undefined && result !== null 
            && result.pii !== undefined && result.pii !== null 
            && result.pii.age !== undefined && result.pii.age !== null) {
                console.log(`${result.name} age is ${result.pii.gae}`)
            }
}
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>
        As you can see there is a lot of code and it must be written in the
        right order. Now, we can use 'optional chaining'.
      </p>
      <pre>
    <code>
        const result = database.search("John");
        if(result?.pii?.age) {
            console.log(`${result.name} age is ${result.pii.gae}`)
        }
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>
        The <strong>'?'</strong> is going automatically check if it's
        'undefined' or 'null', and if it's not 'undefined' or 'null', then it's
        going to continue with this line of code.

      <h2>Assignment: Handling Nested Data with Optional Chaining</h2>
      <h3>Scenario:</h3>

      <p>
        You are building a weather app that fetches data from a weather API.
        However, the API response may not always contain all the necessary data,
        and sometimes the properties might be missing or null. Your task is to
        create a function that extracts relevant information from the API
        response using optional chaining.
      </p>

      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create an interface named WeatherData to represent the structure of
          the API response. It should have the following properties:
          <ul>
            <li>location: string</li>
            <li>temperature?: number</li>
            <li>description?: string</li>
            <li>wind?: { speed?: number }</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement a function named getWeatherInfo that takes a WeatherData
          object as a parameter. Inside the function:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use optional chaining to safely access the location, temperature,
              description, and wind.speed properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              Log the following information to the console:
              <ul>
                <li>Location: [location]</li>
                <li>Temperature: [temperature]Â°C (if available)</li>
                <li>Description: [description] (if available)</li>
                <li>Wind Speed: [wind.speed] km/h (if available)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Create two WeatherData objects to represent different API responses:
          <ul>
            <li>One with all the properties.</li>
            <li>Another with missing or null properties.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          Call the <strong>'getWeatherInfo'</strong> function for both objects
          to display the information.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To illustrate this, let's say we have an object called
        <em>person</em> with nested properties like <em>address</em> and
        <em>city</em>. Without <strong>optional chaining</strong>, if we want to
        access the <em>city</em> property, we would need to check if each
        intermediate property exists before accessing the next one:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            if(person && person.address && person.address.city){
                console.log(person.address.city)
            }
        </code>
    </pre>
      <p>
        With <strong>optional chaining</strong>, we can simplify this code by
        using the <strong>?.</strong>
        operator.
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code>
        console.log(person?.address?.city)
    </code>
    </pre>
      <p>
        If any of the intermediate properties (person, address, or city) are
        null or undefined, the expression will short-circuit and return
        undefined, without throwing any error. This makes your code more concise
        and less error-prone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Optional chaining</strong> can also be used with function calls.
        For example, if we have an optional method <em>getName()</em> on the
        <em>person</em> object, we can call it using
        <strong>optional chaining</strong> like this:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            console.log(person?.getName?.());
        </code>
    </pre>

      <p>
        If <em>getName()</em> exists and is a function, it will be called.
        Otherwise, it will return undefined.
      </p>

      <h2>Assignment: Build a User Management System</h2>
      <h3>Scenario:</h3>
      <p>
        You have been tasked with building a user management system for a
        website. The system should allow users to view their profile
        information, including their name, email, and address. However, not all
        users have provided their address information.
      </p>

      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <p>
        Your goal is to implement a TypeScript class called <em>User</em> with
        the following properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>name (string): The name of the user</li>
        <li>email (string) : The email address of the user</li>
        <li>
          address (optional object): An object containing the user's address
          information, including <em>street, city, zipCode</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your class should have a method called <em>getAddress()</em> that
        returns the user's address as a formatted string. If the user has not
        provided their address information, the method should return 'Address
        not available'.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your task is to implement the User class, including the optional
        chaining logic in the getAddress() method.
      </p>
      <h3>Hints:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use the optional chaining operator (?.) to safely access properties of
          the address object.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a conditional statement to check if the address object exists
          before accessing its properties.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Optional Chaining is especially useful in scenarios where you don't
        control the data source and want to avoid unnecessary null or undefined
        checks. It simplifies your code and makes it more robust against
        potential null or undefined values.
