      <h1>Type Assertions</h1>
      <p>
        In <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>type assertion</strong> is a
        method for explicitly declaring the type of a variable, allowing you to
        specify a value's type and preventing the compiler from inferring it.
        <br />
        <strong>Type assertion</strong> is utilized when you need to convert a
        variable from one type to another, such as changing it from "unknown" to
        "number," among other scenarios.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Type assertions</strong> are of two forms: "angle-bracket"
        syntax and "as" syntax. The angle-bracket syntax is the older form,
        while the "as" syntax is the newer and recommended form.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>And here's the same example using "as" syntax:</p>
      <pre>
    <code>
const someValue: unknown = 'hello';
    
const strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;


let someValue: any = "hello world";
let strLength: number = (someValue as string).length;

</code>
</pre>
      <p>
        Here, we are asserting that <strong>someValue</strong> is of type string so that we can
        access the length property.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is how you can use the assertion to invert one data type to another
        and than to use that without to make a new variable.
      </p>

      <p>Here's a brief explanation of when and how to use type assertions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use type assertions when you are confident about the variable's type,
          but TypeScript can't infer it.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's helpful when working with dynamic types (like data from APIs or
          user inputs) or when you know the type more precisely than
          TypeScript's inference.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type assertions don't perform any runtime checks. They are purely a
          compile-time feature, so you must be certain of the type you're
          asserting.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>as</strong> syntax is recommended over the angle bracket
          syntax because it is more compatible with JSX in React and avoids
          conflicts.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        This section is not directly related to 'Assertions'..but we can use
        <strong>'type annotations' </strong> to interpret one class as something
        else.
      </p>
      <pre>
    <code>
interface Employee {
    position(): string;
}

class Manager implements Employee {
    position(): string {
        return "Manager";
    }

    sayHello(): void {
        console.log("hi")
    }
}


//If we don't care about Manager portion and we just wan't do deal with Employee portion, we
//use the 'type annotations'
const Alice: Employee = new Manager()
Alice.position()


    </code>
</pre>
      <p>
        Now TypeScript registers 'Alice' as Employee and we are only looking at
        the implemented portion in class from interface. <br />
        This is useful, because sometimes we can have a class, that implements
        multiple 'interfaces' but we only want to deal with just a single
        'interface'.
      </p>

      <h2>Assignment:</h2>
      <p>
        You are building a messaging application using TypeScript. You have an
        array of messages received from a server, but the server response does
        not include explicit type information for each message. Your task is to
        iterate over the messages array and print the content of each message.
        Use 'type assertions' to tell TypeScript that each item in the array is
        of type <em>string</em>.
      </p>

      <h2>Assignment: Type assertion</h2>
      <p>
        You're building a simple function that calculates the area of a
        rectangle. However, the input data is coming from an external source,
        and TypeScript is treating the dimensions as 'any' type. <br />
        You need to use <strong>type assertion</strong> to specify the correct
        types and calculate the area.
      </p>

      <main>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a TypeScript function named
            <strong>'calculateRectangleArea'</strong> that takes two parameters:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>'length'</strong> (an 'any' type) representing the
                length of the rectangle.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>'width'</strong> (an 'any' type) representing the width
                of the rectangle.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use <strong>type assertion</strong> to specify that both
            <strong>'length'</strong> and <strong>'width'</strong>
            are of type 'number'.
          </li>
          <li>
            Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula:
            <strong>'area = length * width'</strong>
          </li>
          <li>Return the calculated area.</li>
          <li>
            Test your function with the following inputs:
            <ul>
              <strong>'lenght = 5'</strong
              >(a number)
              <strong>'lenght = 8'</strong
              >(a number)
            </ul>
            Ensure that your function correctly calculates the area and returns
            the result.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </main>

      <h2>Assignment: Type Validation with Switch</h2>
      <p>
        You are working on a project where you need to validate data for
        different fields. Your task is to create a function validateData that
        takes an object as input and validates the types of its properties. You
        should use a switch statement to handle each field and validate its type
        according to the following requirements:
      </p>

      <h3>Requirements:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The field "name" should be of type "string".</li>
        <li>The field "age" should be of type "number".</li>
        <li>The field "email" should be of type "string".</li>
        <li>The field "isSubscribed" should be of type "boolean".</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If any of the properties have an incorrect type, you should throw an
        error with a message indicating which field has the incorrect type.
      </p>

      <p>You can use the following template to complete the assignment:</p>

      <pre>
    <code>

        function validateData(data) {
            for (const field in data) {
                switch (field) {
                    // Handle each field here
                    case 'name':
                        // Validate the type for the "name" field
                        // Throw an error if the type is incorrect
                        break;
                    case 'age':
                        // Validate the type for the "age" field
                        // Throw an error if the type is incorrect
                        break;
                    case 'email':
                        // Validate the type for the "email" field
                        // Throw an error if the type is incorrect
                        break;
                    case 'isSubscribed':
                        // Validate the type for the "isSubscribed" field
                        // Throw an error if the type is incorrect
                        break;
                    default:
                        // Handle the case for an unknown field
                        // Throw an error with an appropriate message
                }
            }
        
            // Return a message indicating that the types are correct if all fields are valid
        }
        
        // Test cases
        const dataCorrect = {
            name: 'Alice',
            age: 30,
            email: 'alice@example.com',
            isSubscribed: true,
        };
        
        const dataIncorrect = {
            // Create an object with incorrect types for some fields
        };
        
        try {
            console.log(validateData(dataCorrect));
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(error.message);
        }
        
        try {
            console.log(validateData(dataIncorrect));
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(error.message);
        }
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>
        Your task is to complete the switch statement to validate the types of
        the fields and ensure the error messages are appropriate.

      <p>
        <strong>Type assertions</strong> in TypeScript allow you to tell the
        compiler that you know more about the type of a value than TypeScript
        does. It is a way to override the default type inference behavior of the
        compiler.
