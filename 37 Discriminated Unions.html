        <h1>Discriminated Unions</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Discriminated unions</strong> are a powerful feature in TypeScript that enable you to work 
            with complex data structures, such as object shapes with different variants, in a type-safe way. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Discriminated unions</strong> allow you to define a set of related types and provide a common 
            property, known as a <strong>discriminant</strong>, which is used to distinguish between those types. This 
            enables you to work with data that can take on different forms while preserving type safety.
        </p>

    <section>
        <p>
            Let's break down the key components of discriminated unions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Discriminant property:</strong> This is a property within each type of the union that 
                distinguishes it from the other. The discriminant is typically a string or numeric literal.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Variants:</strong> are the individual types that form the union. Each type corresponds to a specific 
                variant or shape of the data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pattern matching:</strong> <strong>Discriminated unions</strong> work hand-in-hand with pattern matching 
                using the <strong>switch</strong> statement. You can switch on the discriminant property to access the properties 
                specific to each variant.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Here's an example to illustrate discriminated unions:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        //Define a union of shapes
        type Shape = {
            kind: 'circle';
            radius: number;
        } | {
            kind: 'rectangle';
            width: number;
            height: number;
        }


        //function to calculate area based on shape
        function calculateArea(shape: Shape): number {
            switch(shape.kind){
                case "circle":
                    return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
                case 'rectangle':
                    return shape.width * shape.height;
            }
        }

        //Example usage
        const circle: Shape = { kind: "circle", radius: 5};
        const rectanlge: Shape = {kind: 'rectangle', width: 4, height: 6}

        console.log(calculateArea(circle))
        console.log(calculateArea(rectangle))
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            In this example, we defined a discriminated union <strong>'Shape'</strong> with two variants: 'circle' and 
            'rectangle'. The <strong>kind</strong> property serves as the discriminant. The <strong>'calculateArea' </strong> 
            function uses pattern matching to calculate the area based on the shape.
        </p>

            <strong>Discriminated unions</strong> are important because they bring numerous benefits to TypeScript code.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Improved Type Safety:</strong> With <strong>discriminated unions</strong>, TypeScript can 
                ensure that all possible variants of a type are accounted for, eliminating the risk of undefined or unexpected 
                behavior at runtime.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Better Code readability:</strong> <strong>Discriminated unions</strong> make code more 
                readable and easier to understand by providing a clear and concise way to represent complex data structures.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Easier Maintenance:</strong> By using <strong>discriminated unions</strong>, developers can easily 
                add new variants to a type without having to modify existing code.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Assignment: Movie Ratings</h2>
        <p>
            You are tasked with building a simple application to display movie ratings. Each movie can 
            be in one of three states: "Good," "Average," or "Bad".
             Create a discriminated union to represent movie ratings and display the ratings for a list of movies.
        </p>

        <h3>Pseudo Code</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Define a discriminated union called <strong>MovieRating</strong> with three variants: Good, Average, and Bad.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create some movie objects, and each object should have properties for 
                rating (the movie's rating, using the MovieRating discriminated union) and description (message about the film).
            </li>
            <li>
                Write a function called <strong>displayMovieRatings</strong> that takes an object and 
                displays each movie's rating and description using <strong>switch</strong> statement.
                 Use pattern matching to show "Good" for a good movie, "Average" for an average movie, and "Bad" for a bad movie.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Assignment: CMS</h2>
        <p>
            You are developing a content management system (CMS) for a website. You need to 
            handle different types of content: articles, images, and videos. Create a discriminated 
            union to represent these content types and implement a function to display content details.
        </p>

        <h3>Pseudo code:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Define a discriminated union called <strong>'Content'</strong> with three variants: 
                <strong>"Article"</strong>, <strong>"Image"</strong>, <strong>"Video"</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each variant should have properties to represent its unique details. 
                For an article, you need a <strong>'title'</strong>, <strong>'author'</strong>, 
                <strong>'content'</strong>. For an image, you need a <strong>'title'</strong>, 
                <strong>'url'</strong>, <strong>'caption'</strong>. For a video, you need a 
                <strong>'title'</strong>, <strong>'videoUrl'</strong>, and <strong>'duration'</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Write a function called <strong>'displayContent'</strong> that 
                takes content and displays its details. Use pattern matching to handle 
                each content type differently. For example, for an article, 
                display the title, author and content; for an image, dispaly the title, URL, and caption; 
                and for a video, display the title, videoUrl, and duration.
            </li>
            <li>
                Test you cod with at least one content of each type, and use the 
                <strong>displayContent</strong> function to show their details.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <strong>Discriminated unions</strong> are particularly useful when working with APIs, file formats, 
            or any scenario where data can take on different forms. They provide type safety, and make it easier 
            to work with complex data structures.
