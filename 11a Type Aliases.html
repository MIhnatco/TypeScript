      <h1>Type Aliases</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Type aliases</strong> in TypeScript allow us to create custom
        names for types, making our code more readable and expressive. In other
        words, <strong>type alias</strong> is just providing another name for
        something that already exists.
      </p>

      <h3>Syntax:</h3>
      <code>
        <pre>
                type &lt;AliasName&gt; = &lt;Type&gt;;

            </pre
        >
      </code>
      <p>
        Type aliases are created using the type keyword, followed by the alias
        name and the type it represents.
      </p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
            <code>
                type PersonName = string;

                const myName: PersonName = "Jayson";
                const alsoMyName: string = "Jayson";
            </code>
         </pre>
      <p>
        When you put your mouse over 'myName', TypeScript says it's a string
        because we told it it's a string. Because 'PersonName' is purely for us
        as developers, so we can document our code. And even if we put our mouse
        over 'PersonName', it telss us that the type is a string. (It's strictly
        for developer documentation to create code that is more
        self-documenting).
      </p>

      <p>Example:</p>
      <p>
        In real code, you have a lot of lines of code...and you don't need to
        see the function's code to understand it. SO the first function says..it
        will 'print' something, 'thing' is definitely going to be anything. Who
        knows what that is? And at least we know it is a string...So we can call
        the function, but it might not do what we think it does.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
    //bad 
    function print(thing: string){
        console.lot(`Name is ${thing}`)
    }

    print("a house")  //Name is a house.
        </code>
    </pre>

      <p>
        Now if we rewrite the function using better naming and our
        <strong>type alias</strong>, this is going to become a lot more clear.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            //good 
    function printName(name: PersonName){
        console.log(`Name is ${name}`)
    }
        </code>
    </pre>
      <p>
        Now if we collapse this function here, we can see we have a function
        named 'printName' and we must supply a 'name' and that name has to be a
        'PersonName'. And if we don't know what a "PersonName" is , then we can
        just mouse over that and we can see .. it's a string. And we know for
        sure.. it needs to be a person name.
        <br />

        So we use a <strong>type alias</strong> instead of a 'string'. A
        'string' maybe the name or could be a name of an address. It could be a
        name of a business. It could be a name of a fruit.

      <h2>Creating Aliases for Union Types | - or</h2>
      <h3>Syntax:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          type &lt;AliasName&gt; = &lt;Type1&gt; | &lt;Type2&gt;;

        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Type aliases can be used to create custom names for union types, which
        represent a value that can be one of several types.
      </p>
      <pre>
      <code>
        Example: type Pet = "dog" | "cat" | "bird";

        // Using the | we are saying our parameter is a string or number:
        function printStatusCode(code: string | number) {
          console.log(`My status code is ${code}.`)
        }

      </code>

      <h2>Creating Aliases for Intersection Types</h2>
      <h3>Syntax:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          type &lt;AliasName&gt; = &lt;Type1&gt; & &lt;Type2&gt;;
             </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Type aliases can also be used to create custom names for intersection
        types, which represent a value that must satisfy multiple types.
      </p>
      <pre>
    <code>
      Example: type Employee = { name: string } & { id: number };

    </code>
  </pre>

      <h2>Assignment:</h2>
      <p>
        Create a TypeScript class called <strong>Person</strong> that represents
        a person's information. Additionally, create a type alias called
        <strong>PersonInfo</strong> to define the structure of the person's
        information, including: name, age, email, and isStudent. The
        <strong>name</strong> and <strong>email</strong> properties should be of
        type string, the <strong>age</strong> property should be of type number,
        and the <strong>isStudent</strong> property should be of type boolean.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, create a method called <strong>haveBirthday</strong> in
        the <strong>Person</strong> class that increments the person's age by 1
        each time it is called.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your task is to implement the <strong>Person</strong> class in
        TypeScript, including the necessary <strong>type</strong> annotations
        and <strong>type alias</strong> for properties and methods.
      </p>

      <h2>Assignment:</h2>
      <p>
        Create a TypeScript class called <strong>Product</strong> that
        represents a product in an e-commerce application. Additionally, create
        a type alias called <strong>ProductDetails</strong> to define the
        structure of the product's information, including name, price,
        description, and inStock properties.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your task is to implement the <strong>Product</strong> class in
        TypeScript, using the <strong>ProductDetails</strong> type alias to
        define the properties of the product. The class should include a
        constructor to initialize the product's information and a method to
        update the inStock property based on the product's availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've completed the code, create an instance of the
        <strong>Product</strong> class, test the method for updating the inStock
        property, and print the updated product details to the console.
