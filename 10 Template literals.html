        <h1>Template Literals</h1>
        <p>
            Template literals are a way to create strings that can contain placeholders for dynamic values or expressions. 
            They are defined using backticks (``) instead of single or double quotes.
            
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        const name = "Alice";
        const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;

    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    In the example above, ${name} is a placeholder that can be replaced with the value of the name variable.
</p>

    <h2>Interpolating Variables and Expressions:</h2>
    <p>
        Template literals allow you to interpolate variables and expressions directly into the string using ${}. 
        This makes it easy to include dynamic content in your strings.

    </p>


<pre>
    <code>
        function greet(message){
            console.log(`Hello, ${message}!`)
        }
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            We use the 'back quotes', inside we can place a text and then we can use the dynamic value... 
            we use 'dollar sign' with curly braces and then a variable that you want to substitute.
        </p>
        <p>
            So if we call the function..
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        greet("TypeScript")
    </code>
</pre>
        <p> and run this program..</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        Hello, TypeScript!
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            So this is the simples thing we can do with <strong>templates strings</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Multiple Strings:</h2>
        <p>
            Template literals also make it simple to create multiline strings without needing to 
            add line breaks explicitly. This is especially useful for formatting longer text.
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        const poem = `
            Roses are red, 
            Violets are blue, 
            Sugar is sweet, 
            And so are you.`;
    </code>
</pre>








        <p>
            It's also possible to put expressions within a template string. So let's say:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        let kids =  2;
        let adults = 4;
        let totalPeople = `There are ${kids + adults} people`;

        console.log(totalPeople);
    </code>
</pre>

        <p>
            Just as with functions, we don't want to put too many things in a template strings, because 
            it's going to be hard to separate the part of string with the part that's being calculated.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code>
                let kids =  2;
                let adults = 4;
                const totalAttending = kids + adults;
                const totalPeople = `There are ${totalAttending} people`;
        
                console.log(totalPeople);
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            So that's a way you can kind of simplify.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last thing in this lesson we need to mention..we can actually put template strings into other template strings.
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        let kids =  2;
        let adults = 4;
        const totalAttending = kids + adults;
        const message = `There are ${totalAttending} people`;

        console.log(`${message} to seat at the restaurand.`)
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    This has been composed from two template strings and that's all the interesting parts of the template strings. <br>
    They just enable us to easily create strings by composing other strings and pieces of data into one, complete 
    message that we can then use later in our code.

        <h3>Mnemonic Devices:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Think of template literals as strings with superpowers, where you can easily embed variables and expressions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Backticks (`) are your "magic wand" for creating dynamic and multiline strings.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            They are especially useful when working with dynamic content, such as user-generated data or when formatting text. 
        </p>
