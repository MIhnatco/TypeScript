        <h2>Function declaration and definition:</h2>
        <p>
            In TypeScript, you can declare and define functions using the <strong>'function'</strong> keyword. 
            A function definition consists of a function name, a list of parameters (optional), and the code to 
            execute.
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        function sayHello() {

        }
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            The curly braces indicate the beginning and end of function. The code to be executed is placed inside the curly 
            braces and this part of the function is called 'function body'.
        </p>

        <h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
    <code>

function sayHello(){
    console.log("Hello, world!")
}
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            Here, we are going to access the console and we're going to call the <strong>log</strong> function. What 
            we're doing here is we're accessing the console module, and withing that module exists a function 
            called <strong>log</strong> and we call it using parentheses and we add a string <strong>"Hello, world!"</strong> as 
            an argument. So whenever we call 'sayHello', we're going to log to the console the word.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, to call a function we just write the name of  the function, no need of the parameters and add 
            parentheses.
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        sayHello();
    </code>
</pre>

        <p>
            Once the program starts executing the code...this functions is going to load it into memory and it'll 
            be ready to go. Actually, nothing is going to happen until we call the fucntion. Then it'll jump 
            back to the curly braces, where 'console.log()' and will display the result.
