        <h2>Function declaration and definition:</h2>
        <p>
            In TypeScript, you can declare and define functions using the <strong>'function'</strong> keyword. 
            A function definition consists of a function name, a list of parameters (optional), and the code to 
            execute.
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        function sayHello() {

        }
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            The curly braces indicate the beginning and end of function. The code to be executed is placed inside the curly 
            braces and this part of the function is called 'function body'.
        </p>

        <h3>Example:</h3>
<pre>
    <code>

function sayHello(){
    console.log("Hello, world!")
}
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            Here, we are going to access the console and we're going to call the <strong>log</strong> function. What 
            we're doing here is we're accessing the console module, and withing that module exists a function 
            called <strong>log</strong> and we call it using parentheses and we add a string <strong>"Hello, world!"</strong> as 
            an argument. So whenever we call 'sayHello', we're going to log to the console the word.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, to call a function we just write the name of  the function, no need of the parameters and add 
            parentheses.
        </p>

    <h2> Function Invocation:</h2>
<pre>
    <code>
        sayHello();
    </code>
</pre>

        <p>
            Once the program starts executing the code...this functions is going to load it into memory and it'll 
            be ready to go. Actually, nothing is going to happen until we call the fucntion. Then it'll jump 
            back to the curly braces, where 'console.log()' and will display the result.
        </p>

        <h3>Example 2:</h3>
<pre>
    <code>
    function sum(lhs, rhs){
        returh lhs + rhs;
    }
    </code>
</pre>

    <p>So this is just a slight modification of our existing function. We have our function keyword, 
        name of our funciton, we have our we have two parameters in this case. And once we have parameters, 
        we're able to access them within the body.  We're adding them together and we're returning the result 
        of that addition.
    </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        const answer = sum(2,2)
        console.log(answer)
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    Here..we're going to call our function 'sum' with arguments '2,2' and the result we'll place into 'answer' variable. Then 
    we call the 'log' funciton and print out.
</p>

<p>
    By now..we can use our function in a multiple ways.
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        const answer2 = sum(sum(1,1), sum(2,2))
        console.log(answer2)
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            What's happening? Here we have some for the 'lhs', the function is going to get called again and return 2..
            then we have the function for 'rhs' and the return will be 4... and now the 'sum' function is going to get 
            called again...and the return will be 6.
        </p>
        <p>
            The nesting of function can become very messy..so what we can do is:
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        const lhs = sum(1,1);
        const rhs = sum(2,2);

        const answer3 = sum(lhs, rhs)
    </code>
</pre>

        <h3>Mnemonic Devices:</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Think of a function as a recipe: it takes ingredients (parameters), performs a set of instructions (code), and produces a dish (return value).
            </li>
            <li>
                The function keyword is like the title of the recipe, and the parameters are the ingredients listed in the recipe.
            </li>
        </ul>
