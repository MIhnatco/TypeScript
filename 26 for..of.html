      <h1>Iterators</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Iterators</strong> are used to traverse collections of data ,
        and the <strong>'for...of'</strong> loop provides an elegant way to
        iterate over elements.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Iterators</strong> are objects that provide a way to traverse
          through a collection of data step by step.
        </li>
        <li>
          They allow you to access elements one at a time, making it easy to
          work with large data sets efficiently.
        </li>

      <h2>Using the 'for..of' loop:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <strong>'for..of'</strong> loop simplifies the process of
          iterating over iterable objects, such as arrays, maps, and custom
          collections.
        </li>
        <li>It provides a clean syntax for iterating through the elements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <pre>
    <code>
//Define an array of tasks
const tasks: string[] = ['Buy groceries', "Complete assignment", "Walk the dog"] 

//Use the for...of loop to iterate over the tasks
console.log('To-Do List:')

for (const tasks of tasks){
    console.log(`- ${task}`);
}
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>In this example:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We have an array called <strong>'tasks'</strong> that contains a list
          of to-do items.
        </li>
        <li>
          We use the <strong>'for...of'</strong> loop to iterate over the
          <strong>'tasks'</strong> array. The <strong>'task'</strong> variable
          in the loop represents each individual task in the array.
        </li>
        <li>
          Within the loop, we print each task with a bullet point in front of
          it, creating a simple to-do list.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        When you run this code, it will iterate over the
        <strong>'tasks'</strong> array and display each task in the console.
      </p>

      <p>
        In TypeScript, the <strong>for...of</strong> loop is typically used with
        iterable data structures like arrays, maps, sets, and custom iterable
        objects. <strong>Objects</strong> are not inherently iterable, so you
        can't directly use a <strong>for...of</strong> loop with them. <br />
        However, you can use the <strong>for...in</strong> loop to iterate over
        the properties of an object. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code>
// Define an object with properties
const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 30,
};

// Use a for...in loop to iterate over the object's properties
console.log("Person's Information:");
for (const key in person) {
    if (person.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        console.log(`${key}: ${person[key]}`);
    }
}
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>In this example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We have an object named person with properties like
          <strong>firstName</strong>, <strong>lastName</strong>, and
          <strong>age</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          We use a <strong>for...in</strong> loop to iterate over the properties
          of the person object. The loop iterates over the keys (property names)
          of the object.
        </li>
        <li>
          We use the <strong>hasOwnProperty</strong> method to ensure that we
          only access the object's own properties and not properties inherited
          from the prototype chain.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When you run this code, it will iterate over the properties of the
        person object and display their names and values. Please note that this
        is not a typical use case for for...of, as it's more commonly used with
        iterable data structures like arrays.
