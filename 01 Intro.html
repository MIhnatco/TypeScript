      <h1>Why TypeScript?</h1>
      <p>
        Why should we learn <strong>TypeScript</strong> when we already have
        JavaScript?
      </p>
    </header>
    <article>
      <p>
        To gain a thorough appreciation of the advantages TypeScript offers,
        let's begin by examining JavaScript. You don't need to possess any prior
        knowledge of JavaScript to follow along.
        <br />
        Beneath, we encounter a function named 'popup' that serves to display a
        pop-up dialog to the user. This 'popup' affords customization of its
        message and provides various 'options'.
        <br />All seems well at first glance; however, we encounter a stumbling
        block in the very first line of code.
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code>
function popup(msg, options){

}
    </code>
</pre>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The question that arises is: What exactly is 'msg'? Presumably, it
          contains text data, as that would be the most logical deduction.
        </li>
        <li>
          But what about 'options'? What options are at our disposal, and what
          if we don't set any 'options'? And what if we happen to define an
          excessive number of 'options'? These are all questions left
          unanswered. In essence, we possess scant information regarding this
          function beyond its name, 'popup,' and the presence of 'msg' and
          'options' as parameters.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now, here we have the full code for the 'popup' function. We will focus
        only at these four lines on the right.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/popup.png" alt="" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        These four lines set up the default 'options'. If we try to use this
        function without any 'options', then we'll get these defaults. This is
        useful information because now we know the available options.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know there is a 'kind' options and we know that the default is
        'info'. This is probably what kind of pop-up we can display since we can
        make information. Maybe we can make air pop-up or warning pop-ups. We
        don't know because there isn't any documentation for this example
        function. So we would need to read the code further to figure out if
        there are other kinds of pop-ups and how to use them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also have this 'timeout' options, which likely means how long the
        message is displayed on screens. The number is 5000, which seems like a
        lot. But are those in minutes, second, miliseconds? They're probably to
        be in milliseconds becaue 5000 seconds is over an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an imaginary scenario so we don't really need to dig further
        into the code. It's safe to assume that the 'timeout' is in
        milliseconds. If you wanted, this is fine as a consumer of the function.
        We'll actually be able to use this code and probably get an information.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if we were the person who actually had to write and maintain
        this function. We could set our defaults here in the beginning and then
        we write the functionality . This makes sense because once we have the
        option set, we can make the 'popup'. Remember, how we weren't exactly
        sure what kinds of popups were available and we didn't know if 5000 was
        in minutes or milliseconds. Well, there needs to be code to check that.
        And that's what these lines mark with red doing.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/boilerplate.png" alt="" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        So we have our five lines, that's at the defaults which is fine, because
        we want to be able to use this function with defaluts. And then we have
        23 lines to check everything else. This is called 'boilerplate' code. It
        helps us get for we need to go, but doesn't actually do the thing we're
        trying to do which is to just make pop-up... To make pop-up, the bottom
        is where our code is actually suppsed to go. There is nothing yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        We should also write some tests to make sure that our function properly
        rejects broken options and invalid messages.
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/testing.png" alt="" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        For example, the test will check to make sure that the function works as
        expected if we give it a negative timeout, duration, or if we don't give
        a message or if we try to make it unsupported kind of pop-up. The
        function should produce an error in all these situations. <br />
        If we add up the code, then we get 59 lines of code. Remember, we
        haven't written any functionality yet to actually make a pop-up, and we
        already have 23 lines of boilerplate code and six test cases.
      </p>

      <aside class="pullquote float-right">
        There is no functional code here and there are zero tests to make sure
        that the pop-up actually works.
      </aside>
      <p>
        The test cases are there just to make sure we can actually call this
        function properly.

        <br />
        This code is alsy only useful for this one function. So none of these 59
        lines can tribute to any other part of the code base.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>What about TypeScript?</h2>
      <p>Here is the same function.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/ts.png" alt="" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        We still have our five lines to set default values, but we reduce all
        the boilerplate in this function down to zero lines. You can notice
        here, we do have a few extra things on the function line, we set this
        'message' to be a string and that could be any, regular text, and this
        'options' here, has this text "PopupOptions".
      </p>
      <p>
        "defaultOptions" indicates that we are using some kind of pop-up
        options. And it lists out the kind one, and we know that this 5000 is in
        milliseconds because it says so. <br />
        So already just looking at a few lines of code, we can see much clearer
        how are are supposed to use this function, and all the documentation is
        just right here. It tells us what's going on. Here is the complete code
        in TypeScript:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/ts2.png" alt="" />
      </figure>
      <p>
        This is almost identical to the JS code. It's still checks to make sure
        that the pop-up has all the correct options. And it still makes sure
        that the milliseconds timeout is correct, as well. Remember how I
        mentioned that the JS version would produce an air, if anything was
        wrong ..it's actually not possible to make the TypeScript version
        produce an air..
      </p>
      <aside class="pullquote float-left">
        The <strong>TypeScript</strong> code has all the same checks as a JS
        version, takes less code, requires fewer tests and some of the code is
        actually reusable across the rest of the code base.
      </aside>

      <p>
        In this comparison code overall, TypeScript uses 38% less code. And in
        this particular example, there's also another huge advantage ..Since the
        information needed to call the pop-up encode into the type system we get
        lif suggestions, at our code editor, as we type our code. <br />
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/bonus.png" alt="" />
      </figure>

      <p>
        Here are just a few examples of the pop-up that you may see. When
        working with the sample, from the previous slides, we can get the number
        of fields that are allowed to be part of the pop-up options. We can get
        a listing of all possible kinds of pop-ups that were able to create and
        we get a listing of all the data, that's requires call the function. All
        of this makes development much quicker and easier since you don't have
        to guess what data you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you type code, you code will also be significantly more reliabe.
        Since all of this is being checked automatically every time you hit a
        key.
