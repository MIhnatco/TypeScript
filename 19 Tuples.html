        <h1>Tuples</h1>
        <p>
            Tuples are ordered collections of elements with a fixed number of elements, where each element can have its own specified data type. 
            Unlike arrays, tuples allow you to define the type of each element in a structured manner.

        <h2>Creating Tuples and specifying element types:</h2>
        <p>
            You can create tuples by specifying the types for each element within parentheses. The 
            number of specified types must match the number of elements in the tuple.
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        const person: [string, number, boolean] = ["Alice", 30, true]
    </code>
</pre>

    <p>
        In this example, <strong>'person'</strong> is a tuple with three elements, and their types are specified.
    </p>

        <h2>Accessing Tuple elements:</h2>
        <p>
            You can access tuple elements using square brackets and zero-based indices:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        const name: string = person[0];
        const age: number = person[1];
        const isStudent: boolean = person[2]
    </code>
</pre>

        <h2>Modifying Tuples:</h2>
        <p>
            You can modify tuple elements directly by assigning new values to them, as long as 
            the new values match the specified types.
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        person[1] = 31;  //modifying the age
    </code>
</pre>

    <h2>Use cases for Tuples:</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Tuples</strong> are useful for scenarios where you need to maintain a structured collection 
        of elements with specific types. Some common use cases include representing pairs of triplets of values, 
        such as coordinates, database records, or function return types.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can return a tuple from a function:
    </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        function coord(): [number, number]{
            return [3,3]
        }
    </code>
</pre>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>'function coord(): [number, number]':</strong> this function is explicitly annotated to return 
            a tuple with two elements, both of type <strong>'number'</strong>. This means the function is expected 
            to return an array-like structure with exactly two numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>'return [3,5]'</strong> the function returns a tuple containing two numbers, 3 and 5.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can call this function to get the coordinates:
    </p>
<pre>
    <code>
        const coordinates: [number, number] = coord();
        console.log(coordinates); // Output: [3,5]
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>
            In this example, the <strong>coord</strong> function is called, and the returned 
            tuple is assigned to the <strong>'coordintes'</strong> variable.
        </p>

        <p>
            This demonstrates how yu can use tuples in TypeScript to represent structured data, 
            such as coodinates, where you have specific types for each element. Tuples are useful for 
            maintainig type safety and clear data structure definitions.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can create an array of tuples in TypeScript by specifying the tuple types for each 
            element within the array. <br>
            Here is an example of an array of tuples:
        </p>

<pre>
    <code>
        const people: [string, number][] = [
            ["Alice", 30],
            ["Bob", 25],
            ["Charlie", 35]
        ]
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>In this example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>'people'</strong> is an array of tuples where each tuple has two elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                The first element in each tuple is of type <strong>'string'</strong> and the second element is 
                of type <strong>number</strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>

       <h3>Mnemonic Devices:</h3>
       <ul>
        <li>
            Think of tuples as "typed arrays" with a predefined structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use parentheses to remember tuple creation, and square brackets to access elements.
        </li>
       </ul>
