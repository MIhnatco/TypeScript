      <h1>Type Predicates</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Type predicates</strong> are a way to narrow down the type of a
        variable within a certain code block, allowing you to work with that
        variable with more specific knowledge about its type.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>
        <strong>Type predicates</strong> are defined using a custom function
        that returns a type predicate assertion. The function takes an input
        parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the input satisfies a
        specific condition.
      </p>
      <p>Here's an example of a type predicate function:</p>
      <pre>
    <code>
        function isString(value: any): value is string {
            return typeof value === 'string'
        }
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>
        In this example, <code>isString</code> is a type predicate that checks
        if the input <code>value</code> is of type <em>string</em>. The function
        returns <em>true</em> if the condition is satisfied and
        <em>false</em> otherwise.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        The code below demonstrates a common use of TypeScript's
        <strong>type guards</strong>, which are used to narrow down the type of
        a variable within a code block to ensure more specific type checking.
      </p>
      <pre>
    <code>
        //type guard
type StrOrNum = string | number;

function sample(data: StrOrNum){
    if(typeof data === 'string'){
        //...this code runs
    } else if (typeof data === 'number'){
        //...this code runs
    }
}
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>Here's an explanation of the code:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          type <strong>StrOrNum = string | number;</strong>
          This defines a custom type StrOrNum, which can hold values of either a
          string or a number. It's a union type that represents a variable that
          can be either a string or a number.
        </li>
        <li>
          function <strong>sample(data: StrOrNum)</strong>: This function sample
          takes an argument data of type StrOrNum, which means it can accept
          either a string or a number.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inside the function, there's an if-else construct:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>if (typeof data === 'string'):</strong> This is a type
              guard. It checks whether the data variable is of type 'string'. If
              it is, the code within this block will run. This is possible
              because TypeScript narrows down the type of data within this block
              to be specifically a 'string'.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>else if (typeof data === 'number'):</strong> This is
              another type guard. It checks whether data is of type 'number'. If
              it is, the code within this block will run. TypeScript narrows
              down the type of data within this block to be specifically a
              'number'.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These <strong>type guards</strong> ensure that you can safely perform
        operations specific to the type of data within each code block. For
        example, if you access string-specific methods or properties inside the
        first block, TypeScript knows it's dealing with a string, and if you do
        number-specific operations in the second block, TypeScript knows it's a
        number. This improves type safety and avoids runtime errors when working
        with variables of union types.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>'typeof'</strong> operator works only with primitive types.
      </p>

      <h2>Type predicate</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>'type predicate'</strong> is going to allow us to check for
        arbitrary objects, that we actually create.
      </p>
      <pre>
    <code>
interface Square {
    kind: "square";
    size: number;
}

interface Circle {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}


type Shape = Square | Circle;
    </code>
</pre>

      <p>
        Now, we need to have some way to determine what the shape actually is.
      </p>

      <pre>
    <code>
function isSquare(shape: Shape): shape is Square {
    return shape.kind === 'square';
}

function isCircle(shape: Shape): shape is Circle {
    return shape.kind === 'circle';
}

function calculateArea(shape: Shape): number {
    if(isSquare(shape)){
        return shape.size ** 2;
    }

    if(isCircle(shape)){
        return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    }

    throw new Error("unknown shape");
}


//now we can use title
const square: Shape = {
    kind: 'square', 
    size: 5
}

const circle: Circle = {
    kind: circle,
    radius: 4
}
    </code>

      <h2>Assignment: Type Predicates</h2>
      <h3>Objective:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Define an interface named Animal with the following properties:
          <ul>
            <li>name of type string</li>
            <li>age of type number</li>
            <li>type of type string</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Define a type predicate function named isCat that takes an argument of
          type Animal and returns a boolean value. The function should check if
          the type property of the Animal object is equal to "cat". The return
          type of the function should be animal is Cat, where Cat is an
          interface that extends Animal and has an additional property named
          meow of type boolean.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define a type predicate function named isDog that takes an argument of
          type Animal and returns a boolean value. The function should check if
          the type property of the Animal object is equal to "dog". The return
          type of the function should be animal is Dog, where Dog is an
          interface that extends Animal and has an additional property named
          bark of type boolean.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define an array named animals of type Animal[] with at least two
          objects that have the type property set to "cat" and two objects that
          have the type property set to "dog".
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the isCat and isDog type predicate functions to filter the animals
          array into two separate arrays: one for cats and one for dogs.
        </li>
        <li>Log the resulting arrays to the console.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Assignment: Create a User Validation Function</h2>
      <h3>Scenario:</h3>
      <p>
        You are working on a user authentication system for a web application.
        Your task is to create a validation function that checks whether a given
        user object is valid or not. The user object may have different
        properties based on their role, such as "username" and "password" for
        regular users, and additional properties like "employeeId" and
        "position" for employees.
      </p>
      <h3>Requirements:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a type for the User object that includes the common properties
          for all users.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement a type predicate function called
          <strong>isValidUser</strong> that takes a parameter of type unknown
          and returns a boolean value indicating whether the input is a valid
          user or not.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>isValidUser</strong> function should check if the input
          object has the required properties based on their role (e.g.,
          "username" and "password" for regular users).
        </li>
        <li>
          If the input object has additional properties for employees, such as
          "employeeId" and "position," they should also be validated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Test your <strong>isValidUser</strong> function with different valid
          and invalid user objects to ensure it behaves correctly.
        </li>
      </ul>
