      <h2>Scenario:</h2>
      <p>
        You are building a small application to manage a student roster. Each
        student is identified by a unique student ID, and you need to store
        additional information such as the student's name, age, and grade level.
        You decide to use a Map to store the student data.
      </p>

      <h2>Test Question:</h2>
      <p>
        Given the scenario, how would you use the Map object to store and manage
        the student data? Please outline the steps you would take to achieve
        this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add New Students: How would you add new students to the Map object
          using the unique student IDs and their corresponding details?
        </li>
        <li>
          Retrieve Student Information: How would you retrieve student
          information from the Map object based on their unique student IDs?
        </li>
        <li>
          Update Student Details: How would you update the details of existing
          students in the Map object, such as modifying their names, ages, or
          grade levels?
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove Students: Implement a method to remove students from the roster based on their student ID.
        </li>
        <li>
          Iterate Over Student Roster: Add a method to iterate over the entire student roster and perform operations on each student's details.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <pre>
    <code>
        
        interface Details {
            name: string;
            age: number;
            grade: number;
        }

        class StudentInfo {
            account: Map&lt;number, Details&gt;

            constructor(){
                this.account = new Map();

            }

            //Add new students
            addStudent(studentID: number, studentDetails: Details): void {
                this.account.set(studentID, studentDetails)
            }

            //Retrieve Student information
            getStudentDetails(studentID: number): Details | undefined {
              return this.account.get(studentID);
            }

            //Update Student information
            updateStudentDetails(studentID:number, updatedDetails: Partial<Details>): void{
              const existingDetails = this.account.get(studentID);
              if(existingDetails){
                const updatedStudentDetails = {...existingDetails, ...updatedDetials};
                this.account.set(studentID, updatedStudentDetails)
              }
            }
